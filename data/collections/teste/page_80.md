### Nerd Fonts [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#nerd-fonts "Direct link to Nerd Fonts")

Oh My Posh was designed to use [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/). Nerd Fonts are popular fonts that are patched to include icons.
To see the icons displayed in Oh My Posh, **install** a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), and **configure** your terminal to use it.

info

Fonts need to be installed on the host system as this is a UI setting, not a command line, or shell configuration.
This means **when running inside a container or WSL**, you need to install the font on the host system and configure
your terminal emulator to use it.

### Installation [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#installation "Direct link to Installation")

- Oh My Posh
- homebrew
- PowerShell

Oh My Posh has a CLI to help you select and install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/):

info

When running as root/administrator, the fonts will be installed system-wide.
When running as a regular user, the fonts will be installed in the user's font directory.
By default, Oh My Posh installs the `.ttf` version of the font in case multiple versions are available.

```bash
oh-my-posh font install
```

This will present a list of Nerd Font libraries, from which you can select `Meslo`, which includes the `Meslo LGM NF` font we recommend. Note that you can also install it directly via:

```bash
oh-my-posh font install meslo
```

If you're using Homebrew, you can search for and install Nerd Fonts directly:

```bash
brew search nerd-font

brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

If you're using PowerShell, you can use the [NerdFonts](https://psmodule.io/NerdFonts) module to install Nerd Fonts:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name NerdFonts
Import-Module -Name NerdFonts

Install-NerdFont -Name FiraCode   # Tab completion works on name
```

To install for all users, elevated permissions are required:

```powershell
Install-NerdFont -Name FiraCode -Scope AllUsers
```

### Configuration [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Make sure to **configure your terminal** to use the font you have installed. The following sections will show you how to do this for the most popular terminals.

- Windows Terminal
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio
- Apple Terminal

Once you have installed a Nerd Font, you will need to configure the Windows Terminal to use it. This can be easily done
by modifying the Windows Terminal settings (default shortcut: `CTRL + SHIFT + ,`). In your `settings.json` file, add the
`font.face` attribute under the `defaults` attribute in `profiles`:

```json
{
    "profiles":
    {
        "defaults":
        {
            "font":
            {
                "face": "MesloLGM Nerd Font"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When using Visual Studio Code, you will need to configure the integrated Terminal to make use of the Nerd Font as well. This can be done by changing the `Integrated: Font Family` value in the Terminal settings (default shortcut: `CTRL + ,` and search for `Integrated: Font Family` or via `Users` -\> `Features` -\> `Terminal`).

If you are using the JSON based settings, you will need to update the `terminal.integrated.fontFamily` value. Example in case of `MesloLGM Nerd Font` Nerd Font:

```json
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGM Nerd Font"
```

When using Visual Studio, you will need to configure the integrated Terminal to make use of the Nerd Font as well. This can be done by opening the settings
in `Tools > Options > Fonts and Colors > Terminal` and selecting a font like `MesloLGM Nerd Font`.

warning

OTF fonts do not appear in Visual Studio's Terminal settings, only TTF fonts. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75252606/is-it-possible-to-use-nerd-fonts-as-the-font-for-terminals-in-visual-studio) for more information.

When using Apple Terminal, you will need to configure the settings based on the profile you are using. This can be done by opening the settings in `Profiles > Select the appropriate profile from the left panel > Text > Font` and select a font like `MesloLGM Nerd Font`.

This can also be configured via a terminal command. Example in case of `MesloLGM Nerd Font Mono` Nerd Font on the Basic profile for Apple Terminal:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to set font of settings set "Basic" to "MesloLGL Nerd Font Mono"'
```

warning

The command has only been tested on macOS Sequoia 15.5 24F74.

### Other Fonts [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts\#other-fonts "Direct link to Other Fonts")

If you are not interested in using a Nerd Font, you will want to use a theme which doesn't include any Nerd Font icons.
The `minimal` themes do not make use of Nerd Font icons.

[Creating your own theme](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize) is always an option too 😊
