## What [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/cli/unity\#what "Direct link to What")

Display the currently active [Unity](https://unity.com/) and C# versions.

The Unity version is displayed regardless of whether or not the corrsponding C# version can be found.
The C# version is determined by first checking a static table.
If the Unity version isn't found, a web request is made to [the Unity docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CSharpCompiler.html) to
try extracting it from there. A web request only occurs the first time a given `major.minor`
Unity version is encountered. Subsequent invocations return the cached C# version.

C# version display is only supported from Unity 2017.1.

Unity 2017.1 - 2019.1 support two C# versions, depending on which scripting runtime is selected in Player Settings.
This segment always chooses the higher version.
