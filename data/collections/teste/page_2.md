The [Withings](https://www.withings.com/) health ecosystem of connected devices & apps is designed to improve daily wellbeing
and long-term health.

## Accessing your Withings data [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/health/withings\#accessing-your-withings-data "Direct link to Accessing your Withings data")

To allow Oh My Posh access your Withings data you need to grant access to read your public activities.
