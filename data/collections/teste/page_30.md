## Get the source code [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#get-the-source-code "Direct link to Get the source code")

The source is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh). When you want to contribute, create a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) so you can make changes in
your repository and create a pull request in the official Oh My Posh repository.

To clone your fork of Oh My Posh locally, open the terminal and replace `<user>` with your Github username.

```powershell
git clone git@github.com:<user>/oh-my-posh.git
```

## Install dependencies [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#install-dependencies "Direct link to Install dependencies")

- Manual
- Winget

### go [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#go "Direct link to go")

The codebase is in [go](https://go.dev/), meaning we need a working go setup before we can do anything else.
Have a look at the [go guide](https://go.dev/doc/) to get up and running with go in no time!

caution

Oh My Posh needs at least go 1.25.0

### golangci-lint [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#golangci-lint "Direct link to golangci-lint")

To make sure we keep on writing quality code, [golang-ci lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) is used to validate the changes.
Have a look at the [local installation guide](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation) to make sure you can validate this yourself as well.

### nodejs [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#nodejs "Direct link to nodejs")

The documentation is written in markdown and uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to generate the website. To validate your
changes, you'll need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed so you can run the website locally.

### Visual Studio Code [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#visual-studio-code "Direct link to Visual Studio Code")

If you're not using Visual Studio Code yet, it's a great editor to work with go and the project has the configuration built-in.
You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The project has a [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) [configuration](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/.config/configuration.winget) file available to install the dependencies.
Navigate to the cloned repository and use winget to install the dependencies:

```powershell
winget configure .config/configuration.winget
```

Done! Restart the terminal and you're ready to continue below.

## Configure Visual Studio Code [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#configure-visual-studio-code "Direct link to Configure Visual Studio Code")

A default config (.vscode folder) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is available in the repo:

- `golangci-lint` is configured as the default linter.
- recommended extensions available for a smooth bootstrap.
- default run and debug configurations available.

Once the extensions are installed:

- debug can be started by hitting F5.
- all tests can be run using the Test explorer.

## Running tests [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#running-tests "Direct link to Running tests")

The go source code can be found in the `src/` directory, make sure to navigate to that one before continuing.

### Unit tests [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#unit-tests "Direct link to Unit tests")

```powershell
go test -v ./...
```

### golangci-lint [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#golangci-lint-1 "Direct link to golangci-lint")

```powershell
golangci-lint run
```

## Building the app [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#building-the-app "Direct link to Building the app")

The easiest way to validate your changes is to write tests. Unfortunately, as it's a visual tool, you'll want to validate
the changes by running the prompt in your shell as well.

If you already have Oh My Posh in your `PATH`, you'll need to either use that one as an output parameter, or make sure
that the `$GOPATH/bin/` folder precedes the Oh My Posh binary in your `PATH`.

```powershell
go build -o (Get-Command oh-my-posh.exe).Source
```

Alternatively:

```powershell
$env:PATH = "$env:GOPATH\bin;$env:PATH"
go build -o $GOPATH/bin/oh-my-posh
```

## Run the website locally [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#run-the-website-locally "Direct link to Run the website locally")

Open your terminal and navigate to the `website` folder in the repository. Install the dependencies and start the website:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:3000` where you can see your changes.

### Extra tips [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#extra-tips "Direct link to Extra tips")

#### Configure Delve in VS Code [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/contributing/started\#configure-delve-in-vs-code "Direct link to Configure Delve in VS Code")

[Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) config is restrictive by default(string limit especially). You can expand some limits in VS Code(`settings.json` or directly in `launch.json`):

```text
"go.delveConfig": {

  "dlvLoadConfig": {
    "followPointers": true,
    "maxVariableRecurse": 3,
    "maxStringLen": 400,
    "maxArrayValues": 400,
    "maxStructFields": -1
  },
  "apiVersion": 2,
  "showGlobalVariables": false
}
```
