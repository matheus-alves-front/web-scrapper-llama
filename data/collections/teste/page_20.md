Oh My Posh uses ANSI color codes under the hood, these should work in every terminal,
but you may have to set the environment variable `$TERM` to `xterm-256color` for it to work.

info

To display all icons, we recommend the use of a [Nerd Font](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts).

## Installation [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/linux\#installation "Direct link to Installation")

info

Before running the below commands, make sure that you have updated `curl` and the
client certificate store on the target machine.

Install the latest version for your system by running the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s
```

By default the script will install to `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` depending on which one exists,
or the existing Oh My Posh executable's installation folder.
If you want to install to a different location you can specify it using the `-d` flag:

```bash
curl -s https://ohmyposh.dev/install.sh | bash -s -- -d ~/bin
```
