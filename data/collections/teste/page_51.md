## Problem statement [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#problem-statement "Direct link to Problem statement")

Traditionally, the module was the only way to install oh-my-posh using `Install-Module oh-my-posh`.
Today, with the shift to the executable version over a year ago, it only acts as a wrapper around the
executable, offering no additional functionality. Throughout the year, the following changes have been made:

- don't ship all binaries in the Module but download on `Import-Module`
- move all functionality from the Module to the [init](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/src/shell/scripts/omp.ps1) script

There's a problem with the Module due to the following:

- downloading the binary is a problem on company managed computers
- the module syncs cross device thanks to OneDrive sync, causing versions to be out of sync and [configs to break](https://ohmyposh.dev/blog/idiots-everywhere)
- it's impactful having to explain the difference time and time again (for me)

## Migration steps [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#migration-steps "Direct link to Migration steps")

### Remove the module's cached files [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#remove-the-modules-cached-files "Direct link to Remove the module's cached files")

If you added custom elements to this location, they will be deleted with the command above.

### Install oh-my-posh [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#install-oh-my-posh "Direct link to Install oh-my-posh")

See your platform's installation guide. The preferred ways are **winget** and **Homebrew**.

- [Windows](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows)
- [macOS](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/macos)
- [Linux](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/linux)

### Uninstall the PowerShell module [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#uninstall-the-powershell-module "Direct link to Uninstall the PowerShell module")

```powershell
Uninstall-Module oh-my-posh -AllVersions
```

Delete the import of the PowerShell module in your `$PROFILE`

```powershell
Import-Module oh-my-posh
```

### Adjust setting the prompt [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#adjust-setting-the-prompt "Direct link to Adjust setting the prompt")

If you're still using `Set-PoshPrompt`, replace that statement with the following:

#### I have a custom theme [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#i-have-a-custom-theme "Direct link to I have a custom theme")

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config ~/.custom.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
```

And replace `~/.custom.omp.json` with the location of your theme.

#### I have an out-of-the-box theme [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/migrating\#i-have-an-out-of-the-box-theme "Direct link to I have an out-of-the-box theme")

```powershell
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "jandedobbeleer" | Invoke-Expression
```

Replace `jandedobbeleer` with the theme you use.
