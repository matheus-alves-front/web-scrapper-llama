As the standard terminal only supports [256 colors](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/configuration/colors#standard-colors), we advise using
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or any other modern day macOS terminal that supports ANSI characters.

info

To display all icons, we recommend the use of a [Nerd Font](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts).

## Troubleshooting [​](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/macos\#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

tip

If you see an error that says, " [conditional binary operator expected](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/discussions/3429)" you probably need to update to a newer version of bash.

```bash
brew install bash
grep -qxF "$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash" /etc/shells || sudo bash -c 'echo "$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells'
chsh -s "$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash" $USER
```
