# `sched` — Event scheduler [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html\#module-sched "Link to this heading")

**Source code:** [Lib/sched.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Lib/sched.py)

* * *

The [`sched`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#module-sched "sched: General purpose event scheduler.") module defines a class which implements a general purpose event
scheduler:

_class_ sched.scheduler( _timefunc=time.monotonic_, _delayfunc=time.sleep_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler "Link to this definition")

The [`scheduler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler "sched.scheduler") class defines a generic interface to scheduling events.
It needs two functions to actually deal with the “outside world” — _timefunc_
should be callable without arguments, and return a number (the “time”, in any
units whatsoever). The _delayfunc_ function should be callable with one
argument, compatible with the output of _timefunc_, and should delay that many
time units. _delayfunc_ will also be called with the argument `0` after each
event is run to allow other threads an opportunity to run in multi-threaded
applications.

Changed in version 3.3: _timefunc_ and _delayfunc_ parameters are optional.

Changed in version 3.3: [`scheduler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler "sched.scheduler") class can be safely used in multi-threaded
environments.

Example:

Copy

```
>>> import sched, time
>>> s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
>>> def print_time(a='default'):
...     print("From print_time", time.time(), a)
...
>>> def print_some_times():
...     print(time.time())
...     s.enter(10, 1, print_time)
...     s.enter(5, 2, print_time, argument=('positional',))
...     # despite having higher priority, 'keyword' runs after 'positional' as enter() is relative
...     s.enter(5, 1, print_time, kwargs={'a': 'keyword'})
...     s.enterabs(1_650_000_000, 10, print_time, argument=("first enterabs",))
...     s.enterabs(1_650_000_000, 5, print_time, argument=("second enterabs",))
...     s.run()
...     print(time.time())
...
>>> print_some_times()
1652342830.3640375
From print_time 1652342830.3642538 second enterabs
From print_time 1652342830.3643398 first enterabs
From print_time 1652342835.3694863 positional
From print_time 1652342835.3696074 keyword
From print_time 1652342840.369612 default
1652342840.3697174
```

## Scheduler Objects [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html\#scheduler-objects "Link to this heading")

[`scheduler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler "sched.scheduler") instances have the following methods and attributes:

scheduler.enterabs( _time_, _priority_, _action_, _argument=()_, _kwargs={}_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enterabs "Link to this definition")

Schedule a new event. The _time_ argument should be a numeric type compatible
with the return value of the _timefunc_ function passed to the constructor.
Events scheduled for the same _time_ will be executed in the order of their
_priority_. A lower number represents a higher priority.

Executing the event means executing `action(*argument, **kwargs)`.
_argument_ is a sequence holding the positional arguments for _action_.
_kwargs_ is a dictionary holding the keyword arguments for _action_.

Return value is an event which may be used for later cancellation of the event
(see [`cancel()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.cancel "sched.scheduler.cancel")).

Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.

Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added.

scheduler.enter( _delay_, _priority_, _action_, _argument=()_, _kwargs={}_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enter "Link to this definition")

Schedule an event for _delay_ more time units. Other than the relative time, the
other arguments, the effect and the return value are the same as those for
[`enterabs()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.enterabs "sched.scheduler.enterabs").

Changed in version 3.3: _argument_ parameter is optional.

Changed in version 3.3: _kwargs_ parameter was added.

scheduler.cancel( _event_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.cancel "Link to this definition")

Remove the event from the queue. If _event_ is not an event currently in the
queue, this method will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

scheduler.empty() [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.empty "Link to this definition")

Return `True` if the event queue is empty.

scheduler.run( _blocking=True_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.run "Link to this definition")

Run all scheduled events. This method will wait (using the _delayfunc_
function passed to the constructor) for the next event, then execute it and so
on until there are no more scheduled events.

If _blocking_ is false executes the scheduled events due to expire soonest
(if any) and then return the deadline of the next scheduled call in the
scheduler (if any).

Either _action_ or _delayfunc_ can raise an exception. In either case, the
scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate the exception. If an
exception is raised by _action_, the event will not be attempted in future calls
to [`run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.run "sched.scheduler.run").

If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available before the
next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind. No events will be dropped;
the calling code is responsible for canceling events which are no longer
pertinent.

Changed in version 3.3: _blocking_ parameter was added.

scheduler.queue [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler.queue "Link to this definition")

Read-only attribute returning a list of upcoming events in the order they
will be run. Each event is shown as a [named tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-named-tuple) with the
following fields: time, priority, action, argument, kwargs.
