# Built-in Exceptions [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#built-in-exceptions "Link to this heading")

In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from
[`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException"). In a [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statement with an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except)
clause that mentions a particular class, that clause also handles any exception
classes derived from that class (but not exception classes from which _it_ is
derived). Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never
equivalent, even if they have the same name.

The built-in exceptions listed in this chapter can be generated by the interpreter or
built-in functions. Except where mentioned, they have an “associated value”
indicating the detailed cause of the error. This may be a string or a tuple of
several items of information (e.g., an error code and a string explaining the
code). The associated value is usually passed as arguments to the exception
class’s constructor.

User code can raise built-in exceptions. This can be used to test an exception
handler or to report an error condition “just like” the situation in which the
interpreter raises the same exception; but beware that there is nothing to
prevent user code from raising an inappropriate error.

The built-in exception classes can be subclassed to define new exceptions;
programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception")
class or one of its subclasses, and not from [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException"). More
information on defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under
[User-defined Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-userexceptions).

## Exception context [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#exception-context "Link to this heading")

Three attributes on exception objects provide information about the context in
which the exception was raised:

BaseException.\_\_context\_\_ [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__context__ "Link to this definition")BaseException.\_\_cause\_\_ [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__cause__ "Link to this definition")BaseException.\_\_suppress\_context\_\_ [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__suppress_context__ "Link to this definition")

When raising a new exception while another exception
is already being handled, the new exception’s
`__context__` attribute is automatically set to the handled
exception. An exception may be handled when an [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) or
[`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clause, or a [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) statement, is used.

This implicit exception context can be
supplemented with an explicit cause by using `from` with
[`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise):

Copy

```
raise new_exc from original_exc
```

The expression following [`from`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise) must be an exception or `None`. It
will be set as `__cause__` on the raised exception. Setting
`__cause__` also implicitly sets the `__suppress_context__`
attribute to `True`, so that using `raise new_exc from None`
effectively replaces the old exception with the new one for display
purposes (e.g. converting [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "KeyError") to [`AttributeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "AttributeError")), while
leaving the old exception available in `__context__` for introspection
when debugging.

The default traceback display code shows these chained exceptions in
addition to the traceback for the exception itself. An explicitly chained
exception in `__cause__` is always shown when present. An implicitly
chained exception in `__context__` is shown only if `__cause__`
is [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") and `__suppress_context__` is false.

In either case, the exception itself is always shown after any chained
exceptions so that the final line of the traceback always shows the last
exception that was raised.

## Inheriting from built-in exceptions [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#inheriting-from-built-in-exceptions "Link to this heading")

User code can create subclasses that inherit from an exception type.
It’s recommended to only subclass one exception type at a time to avoid
any possible conflicts between how the bases handle the `args`
attribute, as well as due to possible memory layout incompatibilities.

**CPython implementation detail:** Most built-in exceptions are implemented in C for efficiency, see:
[Objects/exceptions.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.14/Objects/exceptions.c). Some have custom memory layouts
which makes it impossible to create a subclass that inherits from
multiple exception types. The memory layout of a type is an implementation
detail and might change between Python versions, leading to new
conflicts in the future. Therefore, it’s recommended to avoid
subclassing multiple exception types altogether.

## Base classes [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#base-classes "Link to this heading")

The following exceptions are used mostly as base classes for other exceptions.

_exception_ BaseException [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "Link to this definition")

The base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly
inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception")). If
[`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") is called on an instance of this class, the representation of
the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when
there were no arguments.

args [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.args "Link to this definition")

The tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor. Some built-in
exceptions (like [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError")) expect a certain number of arguments and
assign a special meaning to the elements of this tuple, while others are
usually called only with a single string giving an error message.

with\_traceback( _tb_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.with_traceback "Link to this definition")

This method sets _tb_ as the new traceback for the exception and returns
the exception object. It was more commonly used before the exception
chaining features of [**PEP 3134**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3134/) became available. The following example
shows how we can convert an instance of `SomeException` into an
instance of `OtherException` while preserving the traceback. Once
raised, the current frame is pushed onto the traceback of the
`OtherException`, as would have happened to the traceback of the
original `SomeException` had we allowed it to propagate to the caller.

Copy

```
try:
    ...
except SomeException:
    tb = sys.exception().__traceback__
    raise OtherException(...).with_traceback(tb)
```

\_\_traceback\_\_ [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "Link to this definition")

A writable field that holds the
[traceback object](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#traceback-objects) associated with this
exception. See also: [The raise statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise).

add\_note( _note_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.add_note "Link to this definition")

Add the string `note` to the exception’s notes which appear in the standard
traceback after the exception string. A [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised if `note`
is not a string.

Added in version 3.11.

\_\_notes\_\_ [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__notes__ "Link to this definition")

A list of the notes of this exception, which were added with [`add_note()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.add_note "BaseException.add_note").
This attribute is created when [`add_note()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.add_note "BaseException.add_note") is called.

Added in version 3.11.

_exception_ Exception [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Link to this definition")

All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All
user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.

_exception_ ArithmeticError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ArithmeticError "Link to this definition")

The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various
arithmetic errors: [`OverflowError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError"), [`ZeroDivisionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "ZeroDivisionError"),
[`FloatingPointError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FloatingPointError "FloatingPointError").

_exception_ BufferError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BufferError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a [buffer](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) related operation cannot be
performed.

_exception_ LookupError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#LookupError "Link to this definition")

The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on
a mapping or sequence is invalid: [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError"), [`KeyError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "KeyError"). This
can be raised directly by [`codecs.lookup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codecs.lookup "codecs.lookup").

## Concrete exceptions [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#concrete-exceptions "Link to this heading")

The following exceptions are the exceptions that are usually raised.

_exception_ AssertionError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an [`assert`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert) statement fails.

_exception_ AttributeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an attribute reference (see [Attribute references](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#attribute-references)) or
assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references or
attribute assignments at all, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.)

The optional _name_ and _obj_ keyword-only arguments
set the corresponding attributes:

name [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the attribute that was attempted to be accessed.

obj [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError.obj "Link to this definition")

The object that was accessed for the named attribute.

Changed in version 3.10: Added the [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError.name "AttributeError.name") and [`obj`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError.obj "AttributeError.obj") attributes.

_exception_ EOFError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input "input") function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF)
without reading any data. (Note: the `io.IOBase.read()` and
[`io.IOBase.readline()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readline "io.IOBase.readline") methods return an empty string when they hit EOF.)

_exception_ FloatingPointError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FloatingPointError "Link to this definition")

Not currently used.

_exception_ GeneratorExit [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#GeneratorExit "Link to this definition")

Raised when a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) or [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) is closed;
see [`generator.close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.close "generator.close") and [`coroutine.close()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#coroutine.close "coroutine.close"). It
directly inherits from [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") instead of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") since
it is technically not an error.

_exception_ ImportError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement has troubles trying to
load a module. Also raised when the “from list” in `from ... import`
has a name that cannot be found.

The optional _name_ and _path_ keyword-only arguments
set the corresponding attributes:

name [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the module that was attempted to be imported.

path [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.path "Link to this definition")

The path to any file which triggered the exception.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.name "ImportError.name") and [`path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError.path "ImportError.path") attributes.

_exception_ ModuleNotFoundError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError "Link to this definition")

A subclass of [`ImportError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportError "ImportError") which is raised by [`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import)
when a module could not be located. It is also raised when `None`
is found in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules "sys.modules").

Added in version 3.6.

_exception_ IndexError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range. (Slice indices are
silently truncated to fall in the allowed range; if an index is not an
integer, [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") is raised.)

_exception_ KeyError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.

_exception_ KeyboardInterrupt [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "Link to this definition")

Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally `Control`- `C` or
`Delete`). During execution, a check for interrupts is made
regularly. The exception inherits from [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") so as to not be
accidentally caught by code that catches [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") and thus prevent
the interpreter from exiting.

Note

Catching a [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") requires special consideration.
Because it can be raised at unpredictable points, it may, in some
circumstances, leave the running program in an inconsistent state. It is
generally best to allow [`KeyboardInterrupt`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt "KeyboardInterrupt") to end the program as
quickly as possible or avoid raising it entirely. (See
[Note on Signal Handlers and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#handlers-and-exceptions).)

_exception_ MemoryError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be
rescued (by deleting some objects). The associated value is a string indicating
what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the
underlying memory management architecture (C’s `malloc()` function), the
interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation; it
nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in
case a run-away program was the cause.

_exception_ NameError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a local or global name is not found. This applies only to
unqualified names. The associated value is an error message that includes the
name that could not be found.

The optional _name_ keyword-only argument sets the attribute:

name [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError.name "Link to this definition")

The name of the variable that was attempted to be accessed.

Changed in version 3.10: Added the [`name`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError.name "NameError.name") attribute.

_exception_ NotImplementedError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "Link to this definition")

This exception is derived from [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). In user defined base
classes, abstract methods should raise this exception when they require
derived classes to override the method, or while the class is being
developed to indicate that the real implementation still needs to be added.

Note

It should not be used to indicate that an operator or method is not
meant to be supported at all – in that case either leave the operator /
method undefined or, if a subclass, set it to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None").

Caution

`NotImplementedError` and `NotImplemented` are not
interchangeable. This exception should only be used as described
above; see [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") for details on correct usage of
the built-in constant.

_exception_ OSError(\[ _arg_\]) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "Link to this definition")_exception_ OSError( _errno_, _strerror_\[, _filename_\[, _winerror_\[, _filename2_\]\]\])

This exception is raised when a system function returns a system-related
error, including I/O failures such as “file not found” or “disk full”
(not for illegal argument types or other incidental errors).

The second form of the constructor sets the corresponding attributes,
described below. The attributes default to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None") if not
specified. For backwards compatibility, if three arguments are passed,
the [`args`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.args "BaseException.args") attribute contains only a 2-tuple
of the first two constructor arguments.

The constructor often actually returns a subclass of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), as
described in [OS exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#os-exceptions) below. The particular subclass depends on
the final [`errno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.errno "OSError.errno") value. This behaviour only occurs when
constructing [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") directly or via an alias, and is not
inherited when subclassing.

errno [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.errno "Link to this definition")

A numeric error code from the C variable `errno`.

winerror [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.winerror "Link to this definition")

Under Windows, this gives you the native
Windows error code. The [`errno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.errno "OSError.errno") attribute is then an approximate
translation, in POSIX terms, of that native error code.

Under Windows, if the _winerror_ constructor argument is an integer,
the [`errno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.errno "OSError.errno") attribute is determined from the Windows error code,
and the _errno_ argument is ignored. On other platforms, the
_winerror_ argument is ignored, and the [`winerror`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.winerror "OSError.winerror") attribute
does not exist.

strerror [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.strerror "Link to this definition")

The corresponding error message, as provided by
the operating system. It is formatted by the C
functions `perror()` under POSIX, and `FormatMessage()`
under Windows.

filename [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.filename "Link to this definition")filename2 [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.filename2 "Link to this definition")

For exceptions that involve a file system path (such as [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open "open") or
[`os.unlink()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.unlink "os.unlink")), [`filename`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.filename "OSError.filename") is the file name passed to the function.
For functions that involve two file system paths (such as
[`os.rename()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename "os.rename")), [`filename2`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.filename2 "OSError.filename2") corresponds to the second
file name passed to the function.

Changed in version 3.3: [`EnvironmentError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EnvironmentError "EnvironmentError"), [`IOError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IOError "IOError"), [`WindowsError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#WindowsError "WindowsError"),
[`socket.error`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.error "socket.error"), [`select.error`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.error "select.error") and
`mmap.error` have been merged into [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), and the
constructor may return a subclass.

Changed in version 3.4: The [`filename`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError.filename "OSError.filename") attribute is now the original file name passed to
the function, instead of the name encoded to or decoded from the
[filesystem encoding and error handler](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler). Also, the _filename2_
constructor argument and attribute was added.

_exception_ OverflowError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be
represented. This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise
[`MemoryError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError "MemoryError") than give up). However, for historical reasons,
OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required
range. Because of the lack of standardization of floating-point exception
handling in C, most floating-point operations are not checked.

_exception_ PythonFinalizationError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PythonFinalizationError "Link to this definition")

This exception is derived from [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). It is raised when
an operation is blocked during interpreter shutdown also known as
[Python finalization](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-interpreter-shutdown).

Examples of operations which can be blocked with a
[`PythonFinalizationError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PythonFinalizationError "PythonFinalizationError") during the Python finalization:

- Creating a new Python thread.

- [`Joining`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") a running daemon thread.

- [`os.fork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fork "os.fork").


See also the [`sys.is_finalizing()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.is_finalizing "sys.is_finalizing") function.

Added in version 3.13: Previously, a plain [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised.

Changed in version 3.14: [`threading.Thread.join()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.join "threading.Thread.join") can now raise this exception.

_exception_ RecursionError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RecursionError "Link to this definition")

This exception is derived from [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError"). It is raised when the
interpreter detects that the maximum recursion depth (see
[`sys.getrecursionlimit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getrecursionlimit "sys.getrecursionlimit")) is exceeded.

Added in version 3.5: Previously, a plain [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") was raised.

_exception_ ReferenceError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ReferenceError "Link to this definition")

This exception is raised when a weak reference proxy, created by the
[`weakref.proxy()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.proxy "weakref.proxy") function, is used to access an attribute of the referent
after it has been garbage collected. For more information on weak references,
see the [`weakref`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#module-weakref "weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries.") module.

_exception_ RuntimeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an error is detected that doesn’t fall in any of the other
categories. The associated value is a string indicating what precisely went
wrong.

_exception_ StopIteration [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "Link to this definition")

Raised by built-in function [`next()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next "next") and an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator)'s
[`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__ "iterator.__next__") method to signal that there are no further
items produced by the iterator.

value [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration.value "Link to this definition")

The exception object has a single attribute `value`, which is
given as an argument when constructing the exception, and defaults
to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None "None").

When a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) or [coroutine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-coroutine) function
returns, a new [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") instance is
raised, and the value returned by the function is used as the
[`value`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration.value "StopIteration.value") parameter to the constructor of the exception.

If a generator code directly or indirectly raises [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration"),
it is converted into a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") (retaining the
[`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration") as the new exception’s cause).

Changed in version 3.3: Added `value` attribute and the ability for generator functions to
use it to return a value.

Changed in version 3.5: Introduced the RuntimeError transformation via
`from __future__ import generator_stop`, see [**PEP 479**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0479/).

Changed in version 3.7: Enable [**PEP 479**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0479/) for all code by default: a [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration "StopIteration")
error raised in a generator is transformed into a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").

_exception_ StopAsyncIteration [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopAsyncIteration "Link to this definition")

Must be raised by [`__anext__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__anext__ "object.__anext__") method of an
[asynchronous iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-asynchronous-iterator) object to stop the iteration.

Added in version 3.5.

_exception_ SyntaxError( _message_, _details_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error. This may occur in an
[`import`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statement, in a call to the built-in functions
[`compile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile "compile"), [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec "exec"),
or [`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval "eval"), or when reading the initial script or standard input
(also interactively).

The [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "str") of the exception instance returns only the error message.
Details is a tuple whose members are also available as separate attributes.

filename [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.filename "Link to this definition")

The name of the file the syntax error occurred in.

lineno [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.lineno "Link to this definition")

Which line number in the file the error occurred in. This is
1-indexed: the first line in the file has a `lineno` of 1.

offset [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.offset "Link to this definition")

The column in the line where the error occurred. This is
1-indexed: the first character in the line has an `offset` of 1.

text [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.text "Link to this definition")

The source code text involved in the error.

end\_lineno [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.end_lineno "Link to this definition")

Which line number in the file the error occurred ends in. This is
1-indexed: the first line in the file has a `lineno` of 1.

end\_offset [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.end_offset "Link to this definition")

The column in the end line where the error occurred finishes. This is
1-indexed: the first character in the line has an `offset` of 1.

For errors in f-string fields, the message is prefixed by “f-string: ”
and the offsets are offsets in a text constructed from the replacement
expression. For example, compiling f’Bad {a b} field’ results in this
args attribute: (‘f-string: …’, (‘’, 1, 2, ‘(a b)n’, 1, 5)).

Changed in version 3.10: Added the [`end_lineno`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.end_lineno "SyntaxError.end_lineno") and [`end_offset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError.end_offset "SyntaxError.end_offset") attributes.

_exception_ IndentationError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndentationError "Link to this definition")

Base class for syntax errors related to incorrect indentation. This is a
subclass of [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError").

_exception_ TabError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TabError "Link to this definition")

Raised when indentation contains an inconsistent use of tabs and spaces.
This is a subclass of [`IndentationError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndentationError "IndentationError").

_exception_ SystemError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not
look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope. The associated value is a
string indicating what went wrong (in low-level terms). In [CPython](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-CPython),
this could be raised by incorrectly using Python’s C API, such as returning
a `NULL` value without an exception set.

If you’re confident that this exception wasn’t your fault, or the fault of
a package you’re using, you should report this to the author or maintainer
of your Python interpreter.
Be sure to report the version of the Python interpreter (`sys.version`; it is
also printed at the start of an interactive Python session), the exact error
message (the exception’s associated value) and if possible the source of the
program that triggered the error.

_exception_ SystemExit [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit "Link to this definition")

This exception is raised by the [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit") function. It inherits from
[`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") instead of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") so that it is not accidentally
caught by code that catches [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception"). This allows the exception to
properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit. When it is not
handled, the Python interpreter exits; no stack traceback is printed. The
constructor accepts the same optional argument passed to [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit").
If the value is an integer, it specifies the system exit status (passed to
C’s `exit()` function); if it is `None`, the exit status is zero; if
it has another type (such as a string), the object’s value is printed and
the exit status is one.

A call to [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit") is translated into an exception so that clean-up
handlers ( [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clauses of [`try`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try) statements) can be
executed, and so that a debugger can execute a script without running the risk
of losing control. The [`os._exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os._exit "os._exit") function can be used if it is
absolutely positively necessary to exit immediately (for example, in the child
process after a call to [`os.fork()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fork "os.fork")).

code [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit.code "Link to this definition")

The exit status or error message that is passed to the constructor.
(Defaults to `None`.)

_exception_ TypeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate
type. The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch.

This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted
operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be. If an object
is meant to support a given operation but has not yet provided an
implementation, [`NotImplementedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError") is the proper exception to raise.

Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "list") when an
[`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "int") is expected) should result in a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"), but passing
arguments with the wrong value (e.g. a number outside expected boundaries)
should result in a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

_exception_ UnboundLocalError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnboundLocalError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but
no value has been bound to that variable. This is a subclass of
[`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError").

_exception_ UnicodeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs. It is a
subclass of [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError").

[`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError") has attributes that describe the encoding or decoding
error. For example, `err.object[err.start:err.end]` gives the particular
invalid input that the codec failed on.

encoding [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.encoding "Link to this definition")

The name of the encoding that raised the error.

reason [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.reason "Link to this definition")

A string describing the specific codec error.

object [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.object "Link to this definition")

The object the codec was attempting to encode or decode.

start [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.start "Link to this definition")

The first index of invalid data in [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object").

This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an
absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime.

end [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError.end "Link to this definition")

The index after the last invalid data in [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "object").

This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an
absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime.

_exception_ UnicodeEncodeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeEncodeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding. It is a subclass of
[`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError").

_exception_ UnicodeDecodeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding. It is a subclass of
[`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError").

_exception_ UnicodeTranslateError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeTranslateError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translating. It is a subclass
of [`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError").

_exception_ ValueError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the
right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a
more precise exception such as [`IndexError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError "IndexError").

_exception_ ZeroDivisionError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError "Link to this definition")

Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. The
associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the
operation.

The following exceptions are kept for compatibility with previous versions;
starting from Python 3.3, they are aliases of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError").

_exception_ EnvironmentError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EnvironmentError "Link to this definition")_exception_ IOError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IOError "Link to this definition")_exception_ WindowsError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#WindowsError "Link to this definition")

Only available on Windows.

### OS exceptions [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#os-exceptions "Link to this heading")

The following exceptions are subclasses of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), they get raised
depending on the system error code.

_exception_ BlockingIOError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError "Link to this definition")

for non-blocking operation.
Corresponds to `errno` [`EAGAIN`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EAGAIN "errno.EAGAIN"), [`EALREADY`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EALREADY "errno.EALREADY"),
[`EWOULDBLOCK`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EWOULDBLOCK "errno.EWOULDBLOCK") and [`EINPROGRESS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EINPROGRESS "errno.EINPROGRESS").

In addition to those of [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError"), [`BlockingIOError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError "BlockingIOError") can have
one more attribute:

characters\_written [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError.characters_written "Link to this definition")

An integer containing the number of characters written to the stream
before it blocked. This attribute is available when using the
buffered I/O classes from the [`io`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io "io: Core tools for working with streams.") module.

_exception_ ChildProcessError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ChildProcessError "Link to this definition")

Raised when an operation on a child process failed.
Corresponds to `errno` [`ECHILD`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECHILD "errno.ECHILD").

_exception_ ConnectionError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "Link to this definition")

A base class for connection-related issues.

Subclasses are [`BrokenPipeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BrokenPipeError "BrokenPipeError"), [`ConnectionAbortedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionAbortedError "ConnectionAbortedError"),
[`ConnectionRefusedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionRefusedError "ConnectionRefusedError") and [`ConnectionResetError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionResetError "ConnectionResetError").

_exception_ BrokenPipeError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BrokenPipeError "Link to this definition")

A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when trying to write on a
pipe while the other end has been closed, or trying to write on a socket
which has been shutdown for writing.
Corresponds to `errno` [`EPIPE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EPIPE "errno.EPIPE") and [`ESHUTDOWN`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ESHUTDOWN "errno.ESHUTDOWN").

_exception_ ConnectionAbortedError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionAbortedError "Link to this definition")

A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection attempt
is aborted by the peer.
Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNABORTED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNABORTED "errno.ECONNABORTED").

_exception_ ConnectionRefusedError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionRefusedError "Link to this definition")

A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection attempt
is refused by the peer.
Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNREFUSED`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNREFUSED "errno.ECONNREFUSED").

_exception_ ConnectionResetError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionResetError "Link to this definition")

A subclass of [`ConnectionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ConnectionError "ConnectionError"), raised when a connection is
reset by the peer.
Corresponds to `errno` [`ECONNRESET`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ECONNRESET "errno.ECONNRESET").

_exception_ FileExistsError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileExistsError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a system call is interrupted by an incoming signal.
Corresponds to `errno` [`EINTR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EINTR "errno.EINTR").

Changed in version 3.5: Python now retries system calls when a syscall is interrupted by a
signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see [**PEP 475**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0475/)
for the rationale), instead of raising [`InterruptedError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#InterruptedError "InterruptedError").

_exception_ IsADirectoryError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IsADirectoryError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a file operation (such as [`os.remove()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.remove "os.remove")) is requested
on a directory.
Corresponds to `errno` [`EISDIR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.EISDIR "errno.EISDIR").

_exception_ NotADirectoryError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotADirectoryError "Link to this definition")

Raised when a directory operation (such as [`os.listdir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir "os.listdir")) is requested on
something which is not a directory. On most POSIX platforms, it may also be
raised if an operation attempts to open or traverse a non-directory file as if
it were a directory.
Corresponds to `errno` [`ENOTDIR`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ENOTDIR "errno.ENOTDIR").

_exception_ PermissionError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PermissionError "Link to this definition")

Changed in version 3.11.1: WASI’s [`ENOTCAPABLE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html#errno.ENOTCAPABLE "errno.ENOTCAPABLE") is now mapped to
[`PermissionError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PermissionError "PermissionError").

_exception_ ProcessLookupError [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ProcessLookupError "Link to this definition")

## Warnings [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#warnings "Link to this heading")

The following exceptions are used as warning categories; see the
[Warning Categories](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-categories) documentation for more details.

_exception_ Warning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Warning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warning categories.

_exception_ UserWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UserWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings generated by user code.

_exception_ DeprecationWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are
intended for other Python developers.

Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the `__main__` module
( [**PEP 565**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0565/)). Enabling the [Python Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) shows
this warning.

The deprecation policy is described in [**PEP 387**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/).

_exception_ PendingDeprecationWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PendingDeprecationWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about features which are obsolete and
expected to be deprecated in the future, but are not deprecated
at the moment.

This class is rarely used as emitting a warning about a possible
upcoming deprecation is unusual, and [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning")
is preferred for already active deprecations.

Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the [Python\\
Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) shows this warning.

The deprecation policy is described in [**PEP 387**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/).

_exception_ SyntaxWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about dubious syntax.

This warning is typically emitted when compiling Python source code, and usually won’t be reported
when running already compiled code.

_exception_ RuntimeWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about dubious runtime behavior.

_exception_ FutureWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FutureWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are
intended for end users of applications that are written in Python.

_exception_ ImportWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings about probable mistakes in module imports.

Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the [Python\\
Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) shows this warning.

_exception_ UnicodeWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings related to Unicode.

_exception_ EncodingWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EncodingWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings related to encodings.

See [Opt-in EncodingWarning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io-encoding-warning) for details.

Added in version 3.10.

_exception_ BytesWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BytesWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings related to [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray").

_exception_ ResourceWarning [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ResourceWarning "Link to this definition")

Base class for warnings related to resource usage.

Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the [Python\\
Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html#devmode) shows this warning.

Added in version 3.2.

## Exception groups [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html\#exception-groups "Link to this heading")

The following are used when it is necessary to raise multiple unrelated
exceptions. They are part of the exception hierarchy so they can be
handled with [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) like all other exceptions. In addition,
they are recognised by [`except*`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star), which matches
their subgroups based on the types of the contained exceptions.

_exception_ ExceptionGroup( _msg_, _excs_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "Link to this definition")_exception_ BaseExceptionGroup( _msg_, _excs_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "Link to this definition")

Both of these exception types wrap the exceptions in the sequence `excs`.
The `msg` parameter must be a string. The difference between the two
classes is that [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") extends [`BaseException`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException "BaseException") and
it can wrap any exception, while [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") extends [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception")
and it can only wrap subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception"). This design is so that
`except Exception` catches an [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") but not
[`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup").

The [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") constructor returns an [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup")
rather than a [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") if all contained exceptions are
[`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") instances, so it can be used to make the selection
automatic. The [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup") constructor, on the other hand,
raises a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if any contained exception is not an
[`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") subclass.

message [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.message "Link to this definition")

The `msg` argument to the constructor. This is a read-only attribute.

exceptions [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.exceptions "Link to this definition")

A tuple of the exceptions in the `excs` sequence given to the
constructor. This is a read-only attribute.

subgroup( _condition_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup "Link to this definition")

Returns an exception group that contains only the exceptions from the
current group that match _condition_, or `None` if the result is empty.

The condition can be an exception type or tuple of exception types, in which
case each exception is checked for a match using the same check that is used
in an `except` clause. The condition can also be a callable (other than
a type object) that accepts an exception as its single argument and returns
true for the exceptions that should be in the subgroup.

The nesting structure of the current exception is preserved in the result,
as are the values of its [`message`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.message "BaseExceptionGroup.message"),
[`__traceback__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "BaseException.__traceback__"), [`__cause__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__cause__ "BaseException.__cause__"),
[`__context__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__context__ "BaseException.__context__") and
[`__notes__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__notes__ "BaseException.__notes__") fields.
Empty nested groups are omitted from the result.

The condition is checked for all exceptions in the nested exception group,
including the top-level and any nested exception groups. If the condition is
true for such an exception group, it is included in the result in full.

Added in version 3.13: `condition` can be any callable which is not a type object.

split( _condition_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.split "Link to this definition")

Like [`subgroup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup "BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup"), but returns the pair `(match, rest)` where `match`
is `subgroup(condition)` and `rest` is the remaining non-matching
part.

derive( _excs_) [¶](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.derive "Link to this definition")

Returns an exception group with the same [`message`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.message "BaseExceptionGroup.message"), but which
wraps the exceptions in `excs`.

This method is used by [`subgroup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup "BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup") and [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.split "BaseExceptionGroup.split"), which
are used in various contexts to break up an exception group. A
subclass needs to override it in order to make [`subgroup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup "BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup")
and [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.split "BaseExceptionGroup.split") return instances of the subclass rather
than [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup").

[`subgroup()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup "BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup") and [`split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.split "BaseExceptionGroup.split") copy the
[`__traceback__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__traceback__ "BaseException.__traceback__"),
[`__cause__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__cause__ "BaseException.__cause__"), [`__context__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__context__ "BaseException.__context__") and
[`__notes__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException.__notes__ "BaseException.__notes__") fields from
the original exception group to the one returned by [`derive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.derive "BaseExceptionGroup.derive"), so
these fields do not need to be updated by [`derive()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup.derive "BaseExceptionGroup.derive").

Copy

```
>>> class MyGroup(ExceptionGroup):
...     def derive(self, excs):
...         return MyGroup(self.message, excs)
...
>>> e = MyGroup("eg", [ValueError(1), TypeError(2)])
>>> e.add_note("a note")
>>> e.__context__ = Exception("context")
>>> e.__cause__ = Exception("cause")
>>> try:
...    raise e
... except Exception as e:
...    exc = e
...
>>> match, rest = exc.split(ValueError)
>>> exc, exc.__context__, exc.__cause__, exc.__notes__
(MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1), TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
>>> match, match.__context__, match.__cause__, match.__notes__
(MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
>>> rest, rest.__context__, rest.__cause__, rest.__notes__
(MyGroup('eg', [TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note'])
>>> exc.__traceback__ is match.__traceback__ is rest.__traceback__
True
```

Note that [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") defines [`__new__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__ "object.__new__"), so
subclasses that need a different constructor signature need to
override that rather than [`__init__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__ "object.__init__"). For example, the following
defines an exception group subclass which accepts an exit\_code and
constructs the group’s message from it.

Copy

```
class Errors(ExceptionGroup):
   def __new__(cls, errors, exit_code):
      self = super().__new__(Errors, f"exit code: {exit_code}", errors)
      self.exit_code = exit_code
      return self

   def derive(self, excs):
      return Errors(excs, self.exit_code)
```

Like [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup "ExceptionGroup"), any subclass of [`BaseExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseExceptionGroup "BaseExceptionGroup") which
is also a subclass of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception") can only wrap instances of
[`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception "Exception").

Added in version 3.11.
